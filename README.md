# Development Skills & Lessons Learned

A collection of skill files documenting lessons learned from building applications. Each skill file captures what worked, what didn't, and best practices for future projects.

## Skills

| [Firebase + React App Development](SKILL-firebase-react-app-development.md) | Comprehensive guide covering Firebase Auth (magic links, password flow), Firestore patterns, React contexts, and deployment workflows |

## Purpose

These skill files serve as reference guides for future projects, helping to:
- Avoid repeating past mistakes
- Apply proven patterns
- Speed up development with ready-to-use code snippets
- Maintain consistency across projects

## Usage

Copy relevant skill files to new projects or reference them during development to apply lessons learned.
