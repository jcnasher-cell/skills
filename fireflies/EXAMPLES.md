TRANSCRIPT WITH TIMESTAMPS:

[00:00] Chris Nash: Good morning everyone. Let's start with a review of where we are with the Q4 targets for Formation Homes Ireland.

[00:32] Sarah O'Brien: Thanks Chris. We're currently at 78% completion on the Drumcondra site. We're slightly behind schedule due to the weather delays in October, but we've made good progress this month.

[01:15] Chris Nash: What's the impact on the delivery timeline?

[01:21] Sarah O'Brien: We're looking at a two-week delay, so completion now expected mid-January rather than end of December. However, that doesn't affect our Q1 handover commitments.

[01:45] Michael Collins: From a construction perspective, we've had good cooperation from the contractors. The quality of work is meeting specifications. My main concern is material delivery lead times increasing.

[02:18] Chris Nash: Can you quantify that concern?

[02:23] Michael Collins: We're seeing 6-8 week lead times on some specialist materials that used to be 3-4 weeks. We need to factor this into Q1 planning.

[02:50] David Kennedy: This is a sector-wide issue. We should consider pre-ordering critical materials for Q1 projects now.

[Full transcript continues... 987 total lines]

KEY DECISIONS MADE:
• Approved 2-week timeline extension for Drumcondra site
• Authorized pre-ordering of Q1 materials (budget: €45K)
• Scheduled weekly construction updates starting December
• Agreed to revise Q1 targets at next planning meeting
