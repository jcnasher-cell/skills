## REPORTING OFFICER COMMENTARY RULES

**Maximum 5 sentences** covering all five elements:

### 1. ANALYSIS (Why this matters)
Focus on delivery and commercial outcomes:
- Critical path impact and programme consequences
- Productivity loss or efficiency gains
- Outage/possession window effects
- Cash flow and payment implications
- Handover and commissioning readiness

### 2. ASSESSMENT (Risk/Opportunity Level)
State level and primary driver:
- **Low | Medium | High**
- **Drivers:** HSE controls, supply chain fragility, regulatory/consent timing, subcontractor capacity, weather patterns, contract mechanisms, interface complexity

**Examples:**
- "Medium risk driven by regulatory timing and trade resequencing constraints"
- "High risk driven by supply chain fragility and limited alternative options"
- "Low risk; routine CE with established mitigation"

### 3. CONTEXT (Critical Background)
Include decision-relevant context:
- CDM (Construction Design & Management) duties
- Contract requirements (NEC4, JCT, bespoke)
- Planning conditions or consent requirements
- Utility interfaces or third-party dependencies
- Design dependencies or freeze dates
- Statutory obligations

**Examples:**
- "NEC4 ECC Option C with pain/gain; CE valid per clause 60.1(19)"
- "Fire-stopping sign-off prerequisite for ceiling close-out under Building Control"
- "Planning condition 12 requires bat survey completion before tree works"

### 4. IMPLICATIONS (Wider Effects)
Cross-package, programme, and operational impacts:
- Resequencing trades or packages
- Impact to shutdowns, possessions, or outages
- Enabling works dependencies
- Cost/contingency erosion
- LD exposure changes
- Operational readiness or business continuity

**Examples:**
- "May require resequencing to prioritise Blocks A/C; temporary plant hire erodes contingency"
- "Knock-on to Level 2 works; ward decant date may require change"
- "Delays concrete pour for foundations, affecting superstructure programme"

### 5. RECOMMENDATION (Action + Owner + Timing)
Clear, actionable instruction:
- **What:** Specific action required
- **Who:** Named decision owner (role or name)
- **When:** Decision timing or deadline

**For Unknown/TBC items:** Explicit request for missing data

**Examples:**
- "Authorise weekend working and tower crane hire extension by 14 Nov; decision owner: Head of Construction"
- "Approve CE 017 at Change Board on 18 Nov; Commercial Director to confirm LD impact by 17 Nov"
- "Escalate reinspection with Building Control today; Head of Construction to coordinate"
- "Confirm revised delivery date and CE value by 15 Nov; request supplier acceleration options"

---

## DATA AND COMPLIANCE STANDARDS

### Dates and Times
- **Format:** DD Mon YYYY
- **Add time/timezone** if material (e.g., 14:30 GMT, 09:00 GMT/BST)
- **Never invent dates** - use "TBC" if unknown

## CONSTRUCTION EXAMPLES

### Example 1 — Inspection Failure (Delivery)

**Strategic Daily Brief**

**BLUF**

WHAT HAPPENED: Building Control failed the Level 3 fire-stopping inspection, stopping ceiling closures in Zones L3A-L3C.

WHEN: 12 Nov 2025; reinspection requested for 15 Nov 2025.

WHERE: UK; Hospital Redevelopment Programme; Main Hospital Site, Level 3; Package MEP-FS; Principal Contractor: Alpha Build.

IMPACT: Critical path interiors are paused and fit-out trades must resequence; prelims and weekend working may increase; float on Level 3 reduced; exact delay TBC.

CURRENT STATUS: Under review; remediation plan and reinspection slot confirmation due to PMO by 13 Nov 2025.

**Reporting Officer commentary**

ANALYSIS: The inspection failure halts a critical path activity, risking handover of Level 3 and downstream ward commissioning.

ASSESSMENT: Medium risk driven by regulatory timing and trade resequencing constraints.

CONTEXT: Fire-stopping sign-off is a prerequisite for ceilings and above-ceiling services close-out under Building Control requirements.

IMPLICATIONS: Potential knock-on to Level 2 works and increased prelims if weekend shifts are needed; ward decant date may require change.

RECOMMENDATION: Authorise overtime and additional QA inspectors; instruct Alpha Build to complete remedials by 14 Nov and secure 15 Nov reinspection; decision owner: Head of Construction.

---

### Example 2 — Supply Chain Delay (Commercial)

**Strategic Daily Brief**

**BLUF**

WHAT HAPPENED: Supplier notified 6-week delay on AHU delivery for Block B, triggering CE 017 under NEC4 due to factory outage.

WHEN: 11 Nov 2025; supplier revised FCA date proposed for 23 Dec 2025.

WHERE: UK; Campus Expansion; Block B Rooftop; Package MEP-PLANT; Supplier: Ventrix Ltd.

IMPACT: Block B commissioning window will slip unless temporary ventilation is installed; CE value TBC; LD exposure for Block B handover remains possible.

CURRENT STATUS: Ongoing; CE quotation requested and acceleration options due to Commercial Board by 14 Nov 2025.

**Reporting Officer commentary**

ANALYSIS: Plant delay threatens commissioning and practical completion, with potential LDs and increased prelims.

ASSESSMENT: High risk driven by supply chain fragility and limited alternative AHU options.

CONTEXT: NEC4 ECC Option C with pain/gain; CE 017 valid per clause 60.1(19) factory outage; commissioning requires AHU availability D-21.

IMPLICATIONS: May require resequencing to prioritise Blocks A/C; temporary plant hire costs could erode contingency.

RECOMMENDATION: Approve interim mitigation (temporary AHU hire) and authorise negotiation for supplier acceleration premium; Commercial Director to decide at 14 Nov board; confirm CE 017 value and LD exposure by the same date.

---

### Example 3 — HSE Incident (Safety)

**Strategic Daily Brief**

**BLUF**

WHAT HAPPENED: Reportable RIDDOR incident (fall from height, scaffolding) resulted in site shutdown and HSE notification.

WHEN: 10 Nov 2025 at 10:15 GMT; site re-opening subject to HSE approval, expected 13 Nov 2025.

WHERE: Ireland; Residential Phase 2; Block C External Scaffolding Level 6; Scaffolding Subcontractor: Zeta Scaff Ltd.

IMPACT: All Block C external works stopped; 3-day minimum delay to brickwork and facades; programme impact being assessed; LD exposure TBC.

CURRENT STATUS: Ongoing; HSE investigation underway; remedial actions and method statement review required before restart.

**Reporting Officer commentary**

ANALYSIS: The incident stops all work at height on Block C, affecting critical path brickwork and facade installation.

ASSESSMENT: High risk driven by HSE regulatory process and CDM Principal Contractor duties.

CONTEXT: RIDDOR-reportable fall from height; CDM Regulations require investigation and corrective action before resumption; scaffolding inspection regime under review.

IMPLICATIONS: Delay cascades to waterproofing, windows, and MEP first-fix; increased prelims for standby labour; potential LD trigger if Block C delayed beyond float.

RECOMMENDATION: Coordinate with HSE Inspector for earliest site re-opening; authorise independent scaffolding audit and revised inspection regime; Head of Construction to confirm programme recovery plan by 14 Nov including LD mitigation options.
